Problems:
1. debug raise and fold w/nic (also check why flipping over at end is so f*cked up)
2. fix call check method and ask nic whats up with it w/nic
3. include blinds (make one method call for first and second) NOtfiy player they are blind before just screwing them
4. FIX SHARED PREFRENCES so you can keep players all the time (ie keep them when app is closed and restarts)
5. set up end screen with options fro new game, change players, im doen or change certain players
6. have settings use shared preferences so you can delete players
